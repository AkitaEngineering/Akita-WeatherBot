# Akita WeatherBot Deployment Guide

This guide provides instructions for deploying the Akita WeatherBot. Following these steps will help you set up a stable and reliable weather service for your Meshtastic network.

## Option 1: Simple Deployment (Desktop/Laptop)

This method is perfect for testing, development, or if you only need the bot to be online when your computer is running.

### 1. Complete the Installation

Before proceeding, ensure you have followed all the steps in the `README.md` file's **Installation** section. This includes cloning the repository, creating a virtual environment, and installing the dependencies with `pip`.

### 2. Find Your Meshtastic Device's Serial Port

You need to tell the script how to communicate with your radio.

* **Windows:**
    1.  Connect your Meshtastic device via USB.
    2.  Open the **Device Manager**.
    3.  Look under the "Ports (COM & LPT)" section. Your device will appear as a COM port (e.g., `COM3`, `COM7`).

* **macOS:**
    1.  Connect the device via USB.
    2.  Open the **Terminal** app.
    3.  Run the command `ls /dev/cu.*`. Your device will likely be listed as something like `/dev/cu.usbserial-0001` or `/dev/cu.SLAB_USBtoUART`.

* **Linux (including Raspberry Pi):**
    1.  Connect the device via USB.
    2.  Open your terminal.
    3.  Run the command `ls /dev/ttyUSB*` or `ls /dev/ttyACM*`. The device will typically show up as `/dev/ttyUSB0`.

3. Run the Bot

1.  Navigate to the `Akita-WeatherBot` directory in your terminal.
2.  Make sure your virtual environment is activated.
3.  Run the bot, replacing the `--port` value with the one you found above.

    Linux / macOS example:

    ```bash
    python akitabot.py --port /dev/ttyUSB0
    ```

    Windows PowerShell example:

    ```powershell
    python akitabot.py --port COM7
    ```

    macOS example:

    ```bash
    python akitabot.py --port /dev/cu.usbserial-0001
    ```

    The bot is now running! You will see log messages in the terminal. To stop the bot, press `Ctrl+C`.

## Option 2: Robust Deployment (Raspberry Pi as a 24/7 Service)

This is the recommended method for a permanent, "set-it-and-forget-it" bot. We will use `systemd`, the standard Linux service manager, to ensure the bot starts automatically on boot and restarts if it ever crashes.

### 1. Prerequisites

* A Raspberry Pi with Raspberry Pi OS (or another Linux distribution) installed.
* The Raspberry Pi is connected to your network (Wi-Fi or Ethernet).
* You have completed the full installation process from the `README.md` on the Raspberry Pi.
* You have tested the bot manually using the "Simple Deployment" steps above to confirm it works correctly.

### 2. Create a `systemd` Service File

This file tells `systemd` how to run, manage, and monitor your bot.

1.  From your terminal on the Raspberry Pi, create a new service file using the `nano` text editor:
    ```bash
    sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/akitabot.service
    ```

2.  Paste the following content into the editor. **You must modify the `WorkingDirectory` and `ExecStart` paths to match your own setup.**
    ```ini
    [Unit]
    Description=Akita WeatherBot for Meshtastic
    After=network.target

    [Service]
    Type=simple
    User=pi
    
    # --- IMPORTANT: CHANGE THESE PATHS ---
    # Path to your Akita_WeatherBot project folder
    WorkingDirectory=/home/pi/Akita_WeatherBot
    
    # Path to the python executable in your virtual environment AND your bot script
    ExecStart=/home/pi/Akita_WeatherBot/.venv/bin/python /home/pi/Akita_WeatherBot/akitabot.py --port /dev/ttyUSB0
    
    Restart=on-failure
    RestartSec=10
    
    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target
    ```

    **Configuration Notes:**
    * `User`: If you are using a username other than `pi`, change it here.
    * `WorkingDirectory`: Use the `pwd` command inside your project folder to find the full, absolute path and paste it here.
    * `ExecStart`: This is the most critical line. It must contain the **full path** to the `python` executable inside your `.venv` directory, followed by the **full path** to `akitabot.py`, and finally the correct `--port` argument.

3.  Save the file and exit `nano` by pressing `Ctrl+X`, then `Y`, then `Enter`.

### 3. Manage the Service

Now you can use the `systemctl` command to control your new service.

1.  **Reload `systemd`** to make it aware of the new `akitabot.service` file:
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl daemon-reload
    ```

2.  **Enable the service** to start automatically on boot:
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl enable akitabot.service
    ```

3.  **Start the service** right now:
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl start akitabot.service
    ```

### 4. Check the Status and Logs

Your bot should now be running in the background.

* **Check the status** of the service:
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl status akitabot.service
    ```
    If everything is working, you should see `active (running)`.

* **View the logs** to see the bot's output in real-time (press `Ctrl+C` to exit):
    ```bash
    sudo journalctl -u akitabot.service -f
    ```

Your Akita WeatherBot is now fully deployed and will run reliably 24/7 on your Raspberry Pi.
